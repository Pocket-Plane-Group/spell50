# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = Quite a few priest, druid and mage spells are extended (linearly) in all respects up to 50th level. For example, a 50th level mage casting Fireball does 50d6 damage (save for half). A 50th level mage casting Blur gains the blur benefits for 150 rounds. Note that this applies to you *and* to your enemies.
