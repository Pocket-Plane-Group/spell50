		Section I. About
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Spell-50 NPC Mod adds the following component to BGII: 

(01) Quite a few priest, druid and mage spells are extended (linearly) in
all respects up to 50th level. For example, a 50th level mage casting
Fireball does 50d6 damage (save for half). A 50th level mage casting Blur
gains the blur benefits for 150 rounds. Note that this applies to you *and*
to your enemies. 


		Section II. Installation
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BGII is required. The Spell-50 Mod will install correctly over (or under or
without) the Ascension Mod. It should work fine with any WeiDU mod. See the
webpage for details. 

Unzip the main archive into your BGII main directory. This is normally:
        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\

Run (click on) "Setup-Spell50.exe". 

Then choose which components you would like to install. You may always
uninstall them later by re-running "Setup-Spell50.exe". 

The components should install correctly for international players who have
both DIALOG.TLK and DIALOGF.TLK.

		Section IV. Known Bugs 
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lower Resistance (5th level mage) displays an arbitrary string on the
target (instead of "Magic Resistance Lowered by 30%") when your level is
above 20. Ignore it. 

I'm sure there's at least one other bug. In particular, I only tested (=
cast in the game with a high level caster) about half of the spells listed
above. 


		Section V. Thanks
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thanks to the IEFF/IESDP for explaining the SPL format. 


		Section VI. FAQ (Spoilers)
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Q: Why didn't you include my favorite spell?

A: I wrote a computer program to extend the spells automatically. If any
particular spell was "too complicated" it was skipped. 


Q: What are some obvious spells that were skipped?

A: Magic Missile, Melf's Acid Arrow, Flame Arrow. 


Q: What might I not be expecting?

A1: Spells that were previously capped at 15d6 or 10d6 (e.g., FireBall,
Chain Lightning, Sunfire) are not anymore. 

A2: Some spells have non-standard scaling effects (for example, Spook
continues to last 3 rounds but the save penalty rises; Melf's Meteors will
give you 50 meteors; DUHM gives a huge stat boost; Stoneskin gives more
skins). 

A3: Spells that only ever had one setting (e.g., Delayed Blast Fireball is
always 15d6) are not extended. 

A4: The Priest Spell "Magic Resistance" scales up past level 20 (= 40%) and
is thus not such a hot choice for "lowering" resistance when cast by an
uber-priest.


		Section VII. Changes
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1 Includes:
        * Initial release. 50-th level extensions to some spells. 
Version 2 Includes:
        * GB's Fire Storm, Ice Storm, Meteor Swarm duration fix. 
Version 3 Includes:
        * Redo the 50-th level extensions using only the following fields:
          power, value, time, num_dice, size_dice, save_bonus
          This should fix a number of weird problems (like durations above
          255 wrapping back to 1, or the game hanging when you cast
          pro-magic-energy). Thanks to Lee Jones for reporting this
          problem. 
Version 4 Includes:
        * Self-extracting RAR format, newer WeiDU. 
Version 4 Includes:
        * Whoops, include the right files. 
Version 6 Includes:
        * New WeiDU, who knows. Does anyone still use this mod?
