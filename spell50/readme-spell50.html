      <p>From Westley Weimer's original readme:</p>
<p class="kit_description">Quite a few priest, druid and mage spells are extended (linearly) in 
          all respects up to 50th level. For example, a 50th level mage casting 
          Fireball does 50d6 damage (save for half). A 50th level mage casting Blur 
          gains the blur benefits for 150 rounds. Note that this applies to you *and* 
        to your enemies. </p>
      
      <p><a href="https://github.com/Pocket-Plane-Group/spell50/master/spell50/docs/readme-spell50.txt">The last readme</a> from Wes (v6) is available in the docs folder. </p>
      <p>Cam adds:</p>
      <p class="kit_description">This is not meant to be a balanced mod and, while you may eat a 30d6 Fireball once in a while, for the most part it's going to make the game substantially easier by buffing your spellcasters. It's meant to be fun, even if it can be a bit silly. </p>
      <p>As of version 7, differing spell caps can be selected so the spells can be extended, or trimmed, to an arbitrary level. </p>

    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>As of v7, Spell-50 works on the original and Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, and Icewind Dale.  It should also work on the conversion 
        projects BGT, EET, and Tutu.  Spell-50 does include  Icewind Dale spells being added to BG2 games via mods like IWDification or Sword Coast Stratagems. </p>
      <p>The spells are extended semi-automatically by making certain assumptions, e.g. that Fireball does one die of damage per level, or that Haste lasts three rounds + one 
        round/level of the caster. As a result, it's not going to work well (or at all) with mods that radically alter the spell system, such as Spell Revisions, but it should work with most other mods. Because it's extending spells programmatically it should pick up and continue changes made by other mods. </p>
      <p>In terms of install order, Spell-50 is probably better served going earlier in the install order. If you want IWD spells included in your BGEE/oBG2/BG2EE games then Spell-50 
        needs to follow a mod like IWDification that adds them. Similarly, many kit mods copy their abilities from the original spells, so Spell-50 should try to go ahead of them. Spell-50 
        should definitely be installed after fixpacks (BG2 Fixpack or EE Fixpack) and prior to large mods such as Tweaks Anthology or SCS.</p>
      <p>For modders, Spell-50 will generate the file <span class="code">weidu_external/spell50/spell50_cap.tpa</span>, which you can <span class="code">INCLUDE</span> in your mod. The file will set the variable <span class="code">spell50_cap</span> to the spell 
        cap that Spell-50 used during installation. </p>

        New Player&rsquo;s Guide to Installing and Playing Mods</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
        </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a 
        program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the 
        patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one 
        that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the 
        mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Spell-50 for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. 
        When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-spell50.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> spell50</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-spell50.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-spell50.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>macOS</strong><br />
        Spell-50 for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-spell50</strong>, <strong>setup-spell50.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> spell50</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-spell50.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-spell50.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Spell-50 for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall spell50' in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-spell50 --uninstall at the command line to 
        remove all components without wading through prompts.</p>

    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>Spell-50 has one component that extends the spell cap to one of several present options, or a custom one selected by the player:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>50 (the original option)</li>
        <li>40</li>
        <li>30 (default cap of Icewind Dale)</li>
        <li>20 (default cap of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II)</li>
        <li>1</li>
        <li>Custom value&mdash;open up custom_cap.disabled.txt in the spell50 folder and follow the directions there to enable this option. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that the cap is enforced both ways&mdash;if you select a lower cap, spells which extend beyond it will be trimmed back to the cap. If you do lower the spell cap below a spell's minimum level, in general the spell will still have the effects of its minimum level. For example, Fireball has a minimum damage of 5d6, as level 5 is the first level you can legitimately learn and cast the spell. Even if you select a spell cap below five, Fireball will still do 5d6 damage. </p>
      <p>The following spells are affected. Spells which needed special treatment are noted with an asterisk and details are in the notes below the list. Special versions of 
        spells&mdash;like the innate version of Hold Undead for priests of Lathander, or beholder lightning bolts&mdash;are scaled like their normal arcane/divine counterparts. Also be aware that this list covers all spells in all games affected by Spell-50, but it may not apply to your specific game. For example, Poison is not changed on oIWD/IWDEE games as its effects do not scale, but it will be scaled on the Baldur's Gate series of games since its effects  vary by level. </p>

<h3>Spell-Specific Notes</h3>
      <p><strong>Call Lightning<br />
      </strong>Call Lightning uses a special projectile which caps the maximum number of lightning strikes to 11. The damage is properly scaled out to the level cap. </p>
      <p><strong>        Dispel Magic [Inquisitor]</strong><br />
        Inquisitor Dispel Magic scales at double the caster level. As such its maximum cap is 25, which corresponds to a dispel level of 50, the highest available character level in the game. </p>
      <p><strong>Magic Missile</strong><br />
        Magic Missile uses a special projectile that changes at every level to accommodate additional missiles. However, the projectile maxes out at 11 missiles (level 21). On older engines (original Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate), this means the spell cannot be extended beyond  level 21. On newer engines (original Baldur's Gate II or the Enhanced Editions) the spell will be extended out to the selected cap by having the spell cast itself multiple times to properly scale the number of missiles. For the most part this is done invisibly to the player, though they may see 
        feedback in the combat log indicating multiple casts. </p>
      <p><strong>Mordenkainen's Force Missiles</strong><br />
        Like Magic Missile, Force Missiles is limited by its special projectile. Unlike Magic Missile, this can't easily be overcome by using the same multi-cast solution, so Force 
        Missiles remains bound by the 11 missile maximum, meaning you don't get additional missiles at levels 40, 43, 46, and 49. However, the concussive damage  keeps scaling all the way out to level 50.      </p>
      <p><strong>Poison</strong><br />
        Poison does not have a linear progression so we use its last progression to extend it out to the selected level cap. Every two levels the initial damage increases 2d8; per round 
        damage will remain capped at six but will last an additional round/2 levels. </p>
      <p><strong>Spook</strong><br />
        Spook is not extended at all as the save penalties quickly veer into ridiculous territory. While it has a flat duration of three rounds, the saving throw penalty increases by one 
        every two levels which, if extended linearly, would result in a saving throw of -9 at level 18--meaning an enemy with a 1 saving throw only has a 50/50 chance to resist, and it'll only get worse from there. </p>
