/*
This file is here to enable players to set a custom spell cap. Set the 
number below to a number between 1 and 50, then rename this file without
the 'disabled' part. e.g. custom_cap.txt. If done correctly, you'll see
an option during install for 'Custom Spell Cap' that will use the value
you set below as the level cap.
